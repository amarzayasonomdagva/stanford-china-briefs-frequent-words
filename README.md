## What is Stanford China Brief?

Last summer I interned at Stanford’s Center on China’s Economy and Institutions, where I co-produced Stanford China Briefs, a publication that summarizes academic research for policymakers and business leaders engaged in US–China relations. I translated lengthy, technical findings into concise, two-page insights while preserving nuance and accuracy. 

## The most frequent words used in Stanford China Briefs (as of January 2025)

After taking data science class for the first time, I got inspired to do my own little project. 
I first web scraped all the briefs from the website and did text mining afterwards. I then filtered out common words from the texts, such as china, data, stanford, university, spogli, center... The idea is that you can look at the most frequently used words across about 100 briefs.

An animated wordcloud displayed on the shape of a star. You can see how many times each individual word was repeated.
